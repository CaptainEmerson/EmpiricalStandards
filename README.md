# Empirical Standards

This repository contains the ACM SIGSOFT Empirical Standards for researchers, peer reviewers, editors and publications venues.

The standards themselves can be found in the _docs_ directory. There is a **General Standard**, which applies to all empirical research, and a set of specific standards, which apply to specific research methods such as **Case Studies**, **Controlled Experiments** and **Systematic Literature Reviews**.

In the _Supplements_ directory, you will find a set of supplemental standards that address cross-cutting concerns including **Information Visualization**,  **Sampling** and **Inter-rater Reliability and Agreement**. 

In the _Resources_ directory you'll find slide decks, links to videos and other materials about the standards.

In the main directory: 
 - Contributing.md gives advice on contributing to the standards
 - Empirical_Standards_Report.pdf explains how the standards were created, their costs and benefits, how they should be used and governed, and the scientific basis of the empirical standards initiative. 
 - HowToCite.md explains how to reference the standards 
 - LICENSE.md explains the creative commons license used by the standards
