# Empirical Standards

An _Empirical Standard_ is a brief public document that communicates expectations for emprical research. Here _empirical_ denotes research that uses data. The data can be qualitative or quantitative; real or synthetic. _Empirical_ distinguishes research that involves collecting and analyzing data from other kinds of scholarship like a mathematical proof or a philosophical treatise. 

Moreover, our empirical standards are:

1. Method-specific. Software engineering researchers use many different research methods. A single standard for all empirical research would either be biased against some methods or vague to the point of uselessness. We have totally different expectations for a controlled experiment and an ethnographic case study. Therefore, we need different standards for different methods.
2. Models of the software engineering community's expectations. That is, most of a standard should appear reasonable to most of the subset of our community that's familiar with that kind of research. The standards should both reflect, and help build, consensus. 
  
## What are Empirical Standards for?

The empirical standards have three main uses:

1. Fixing peer review
2. Designing better studies
3. Educating graduate students

Scholarly peer review is simultaneously “the lynchpin about which the whole business of science is pivoted" [1] and "prejudiced, capricious, inefficient, ineffective, and generally unscientific” [2]. Many of the problems with peer review boild down to reviewers inventing their own evaluation criteria. Devising appropriate evaluation criteria for any given manuscript is extraordinarily difficult, so most reviewers' criteria are not very good. Reviewers create criteria that are inconsistent with other reviewers', the venue's, the editor's, the methodological literature and---crucially---the author's. In effect, the real criteria by which our research is judged are not merely opaque; they don't even exist until after the manuscript is submitted. This is why peer review is so frustrating, unpredictable, and unscientific. 

Empirical standards are the secret to fixing this situation. With the standards, all the reviewers use the same criteria and the authors know the criteria in advance. Used appropriately, the standards discourage or prevent reviewers from either accepting research with fatal flaws or rejecting research based on bogus criteria. 

Obviously, if authors have these criteria in advance, they can use the criteria to design more rigorous studies. There's a lot to remember when designing a study, and robust methodological training is rare in our community. The standards provide concise, convenient checklists to help us remember all the core practices for a given method.  

The standards can also be used for educational purposes. While they cannot replace a good methods textbook, the lists of references and exemplars can be used to construct reading lists, and the specific attributes can be used to sheppherd graduate students through their study designs and paper write-ups.  

## Creation and Maintenance

You can learn more about how the standards were created and are maintained by reading the empirical standards report [3].

<!--
## Repository Structure
The standards themselves can be found in the _docs_ directory. There is a **General Standard**, which applies to all empirical research, and a set of specific standards, which apply to specific research methods such as **Case Studies**, **Controlled Experiments** and **Systematic Literature Reviews**.
In the _Supplements_ directory, you will find a set of supplemental standards that address cross-cutting concerns including **Information Visualization**,  **Sampling** and **Inter-rater Reliability and Agreement**. 
In the _Resources_ directory you'll find slide decks, links to videos and other materials about the standards.
In the main directory: 
 - Contributing.md gives advice on contributing to the standards
 - Empirical_Standards_Report.pdf explains how the standards were created, their costs and benefits, how they should be used and governed, and the scientific basis of the empirical standards initiative. 
 - HowToCite.md explains how to reference the standards 
 - LICENSE.md explains the creative commons license used by the standards
