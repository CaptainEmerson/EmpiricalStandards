Research that invents and evaluates technological artifacts

### Application {#application-1 .Standard.Heading}

This standard applies to manuscripts that propose and evaluate
technological artifacts, including algorithms, models, languages,
methods, systems, tools, and other computer-based technologies. This
standard is not appropriate for:

    (consider the Experiments Standard)

-   experience reports of applying pre-existing engineering research
    approaches

### General Quality Criteria {#general-quality-criteria-1 .Standard.Heading}

-   Comprehensiveness of proposed artifact description

-   Appropriateness of evaluation methods to the nature, goals, and
    assumptions of the contribution

-   Relationship of innovativeness to rigorousness: less innovative
    artifacts require more rigorous evaluations

### Antipatterns

-   overstates the novelty of the contribution

-   omits details of key conceptual aspects while focusing exclusively
    on incidental implementation aspects

-   evaluation consists *only* of eliciting users' opinions of the
    artifact

-   evaluation consists *only* of quantitative performance data that is
    not compared to established benchmarks or alternative solutions (see
    related point in "Invalid Criticism")

### Invalid Criticisms

-   The paper does not report as ambitious an empirical study as other
    predominately empirical papers. The more innovative the artifact and
    more comprehensive the conceptual evaluation, the less we should
    expect from the empirical study.

-   Too few experimental subjects (e.g. the source code used to evaluate
    a static analysis technique) if few subjects are available in the
    contribution's domain or the experimental evaluation is part of a
    more comprehensive validation strategy (e.g. formal arguments).
    Other criteria, such as the variety, realism, availability, and
    scale of the subjects, should also be considered to assess the
    quality of the evaluation.

-   No replication package, if there are clear, convincing practical or
    ethical reasons preventing artifact disclosure.

-   The artifact is not experimentally compared with related approaches
    *that are not publicly available*. In other words, before saying
    "you should have compared this against X, make sure X is actually
    available and functional.

-   This is not the first known solution to the identified problem. The
    novelty of the paper can be in how it achieves scalability, better
    performance on specific classes of problems, applicability to
    realistic systems, stronger theoretical guarantees, or other aspects
    of improvement. Proposed artifacts should outperform existing
    artifacts on *some* dimension(s).

-   The contribution is not technically complicated. What matters is
    that it works. Unnecessary complexity is undesirable.
