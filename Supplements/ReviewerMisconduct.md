## General Principles

 - Conflict of Interest
 - Discriminating against a protected group

## Specific Examples of Misconduct
 
 - Using the review to promote work by the reviewer or their close colleagues, e.g., by demanding that authors add citations to one or more papers written by the reviewer or their close colleagues
 - Failing to declare conflict-of-interest and reviewing the submission anyway
 - Prejudice dressed up as external validity concerns; e.g., dismissing a study because participants came from a developing country.
 - Distributing the submission to anyone note explicitly approved Failing to maintain confidentiality by, e.g., sharing the unpublished manuscript on social media
 - Submmitting a review without reading the submission
 - Stealing ideas from the submission and rejecting it so the reviewer can publish a similar paper first
 - Intentionally un-masking another anonymous reviewer to the authors
 - Ad hominem attacks on the authors
 - Accusing authors of misconduct (plagiarism, data fabrication, p-hacking, etc.) without compelling evidence

### The Line

Imagine a "line of misconduct." On the left side of the line are reviews that the authors perceive as rude, dismissive, unhelpful or unreasonable. On the right side of the line are reviews that any reasonable person would find unduly hostile and destructive in tone and substance. This line is difficult to pin down. Different reviewers (and cultures) express themselves in different ways. Some authors are more sensitive; others more thick-skinned.  We don't want to criminalize cultural differences. And yet, there exist reviews that are plainly over the line. Moving toward structured, standards-based reviews and away from unstructured free-text reviews may mitigate this problem.

## Specific Examples of Actions or Mistakes that do not Constitute Misconduct

 - Suggesting the authors look at papers not written by the reviewer or close colleagues, even if the authors perceive the papers as irrelevant   
 - Publicly sharing thoughts about a manuscript under review without disclosing important elements of the manuscript; e.g., tweeting "Reviewing yet another manuscript that reports "experiments" with no control groups - so frustrating!"
 - Failing to submit a review on time or at all 
 - Misunderstanding or deviating from a venue's peer review standards or procedures
 - Missing important elements of a paper, skimming sections, failing to engage with a paper as deeply as one should
 - Poorly explaining reasons for rejection
 - Writing a review that is perceived as unduly rude or blunt by the authors
 - Refusing to review a revision of a paper previously reviewed
 - Revealing the reviewer's own identity, intentionally or accidentally, during or after review
