# Ethics (Engineering Methods)

Ethics connected with the invention and evaluation of technological artefacts.

## Application

This standard applies to studies that propose and evaluate technological artifacts, including algorithms, models, languages,
methods, systems, tools, and other computer-based technologies.  It should be applied in addition to other standards where appropriate
to the work being reported.

## Specific Attributes
### Essential Attributes
- [ ] describes anticipated benefits of the artifact in relation to segments of society or individuals
- [ ] describes likely behaviours encouraged by the use and misuse of the artifact in the anticipated context of use
- [ ] describes any burdens created by the use of the artifact and on whom these burdens fall
- [ ] describes measures taken to prevent misuse in the design of the artifact, and those taken to encourage intended use
- [ ] describes potential harms arising from artifact use e.g. in terms of privacy (including surveillance and workplace monitoring), security, exclusion, accessibility, deception, and other societal impacts in relation to parts of society or individuals
- [ ] justifies the potential harms in terms of the benefits and burdens, considering particularly whether potential burdens, harms and benefits are equitably distributed across the same parts of societies in each case, and how the design mitigates the risks identified
- [ ] describes the environmental impact of the work in terms of carbon emissions (for development and use)
- [ ] describes the environmental impact of the work in other respects (e.g. materials, mineral mining required)
- [ ] (for work involving machine learning) quantifies the carbon emissions generated by the work (for development and use separately)<sup>[1](myfootnote1)</sup>
- [ ] justifies the environmental impact of the work against the expected benefits, referencing UN Sustainable Development Goals

### Desirable Attributes
- [ ] relates ethics discussion to frameworks of professional practice and UN Sustainable Development Goals
- [ ] (for work not involving machine learning) where appropriate, quantifies the carbon emssions generated by the work<sup>[1](myfootnote1)</sup>
- [ ] for artifacts emerging from a line of research and where appropriate, quantify carbon emissions over the whole line of research, not just this part of the work<sup>[1](myfootnote1)</sup>
- [ ] discuss relative harms and benefits when describing related work alternatives

### Extraordinary Attributes
- [ ] statement of ethical approval from institutional REC/IRB in relation specifically to the technological artifact
- [ ] statement of carbon offsetting or other measures taken to reduce the environmental impact of the work

## General Quality Criteria

Given the primacy of public/societal benefit in engineering and computing ethics codes of practice, discussion should balance the anticipated benefits of a technological artifact with the potential risks and/or harms to global society at large (including potential impacts on individuals where relevant) and the environment.  Consideration should be evidenced as to the distribution of benefit vs harm among individuals and communities, the potential for individuals or groups to come to societal, financial, or other harm as a result of the artifact's use, and the potential environmental impact of artifact development and use.  This should be evident also in the design: difficult to misuse or unlikely to be misused, unlikely to fail in a dangerous way, risk assessed for failure impacts (Myers and Venable, 2014).  Discussion should be grounded in codes of professional practice (e.g. ACM/IEEE-CS Software Engineering Code, British Computer Society), the UN Sustinable Developmeng Goals, and consider current and future potential appliactions.

## Antipatterns

- Justifying an artifact as beneficial solely on its own merits without consideration of the broad impacts of its use
- Justifying an artifact as beneficial solely on the grounds that it is similar to other artifacts that have been useful and without considering the impacts specifically in this case
- Justifying an artifact as beneficial without considering the potential contexts of use, including those beyond that targeted
- Failure to identify any misuse or risk scenarios

## Examples of Acceptable Deviations

- Justified inability to quantify machine learning carbon costs<sup>[1](myfootnote1)</sup>

## Invalid Criticisms

- &quot;Study was not approved by an ethical review board&quot; is not grounds for rejection unless there is a substantive ethical concern relating to the artifact that such a board should have prevented.
